      <h2>How Our Story Became My Favorite Part of My Life ✨</h2>
      <p>
        I didn’t know that meeting you would quietly, gently, and completely change my world. What started as a simple conversation turned into the safest place my heart has ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
        With you, love doesn’t feel loud or chaotic — it feels calm, steady, and real. It feels like being understood without having to explain. It feels like being chosen, again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, even across miles, even in moments when I miss you so deeply it hurts, I still feel you with me — in my thoughts, in my heart, in everything I do.
      </p>

  <!-- LOVE MODAL -->

      <span class="close" onclick="closeModal('loveModal')">&times;</span>
      <h2>Everything I Love About You 🤍</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The way you show up for me, especially when I’m at my weakest</li>
        <li>Your patience — the kind that makes me feel safe to be fully myself</li>
        <li>Your kindness — not just in words, but in the way you live</li>
        <li>The way you make me feel seen, heard, and deeply loved</li>
        <li>Your strength — especially the way you’re caring for your family right now</li>
        <li>Your smile — the one that can change my entire day in seconds</li>
        <li>Your laugh — my favorite sound in the world</li>
        <li>The way loving you feels like finally coming home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don’t just love you — I feel lucky to love you.

  <!-- DISTANCE MODAL -->

      <h2>Even Across Miles, You’re Still My Home 🌙</h2>
      <p>
        Being apart from you right now is one of the hardest things I’ve had to do. I miss your hugs. I miss your presence. I miss the comfort of simply being next to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I also admire you more than I can put into words — for your strength, your responsibility, and the way you’re showing up for your family with so much love. Watching you care for the people you love makes me fall for you all over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distance isn’t a wall — it’s just a chapter. And every chapter we walk through together only makes our story stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where you are, you are still my person. You are still my heart. You are still my forever.

      <h2>Open When… 💌</h2>
      <h3>Open when you miss me:</h3>
      <p>
        I miss you too — more than I can ever explain. But remember this: this distance is temporary, and us is permanent. Close your eyes and imagine my arms around you, my head on your chest, my heart beating with yours — because that’s exactly where I belong.
      </p>

      <h3>Open when you’re tired or overwhelmed:</h3>
      <p>
        You don’t have to be strong all the time. You don’t have to carry everything alone. Let me hold you — even if it’s just through words right now. I’m so proud of you, and I love you more for the way you keep going.
      </p>

      <h3>Open when you need motivation:</h3>
      <p>
        Look at everything you’re doing — the way you show up, the way you care, the way you love. You inspire me every single day. You are stronger than you realize, and I believe in you more than you know.
      </p>

      <h3>Open when you need a smile:</h3>
      <p>
        Somewhere in the world right now, there is a girl smiling because she gets to love you — and that girl is me 😌❤️

        <li>Our forever — the greatest adventure of all</li>
